Huffman Encoding and Compression: ZIP Command

• Designed a C++ language-based algorithm capable of compressing and uncompressing large text or media files into files that take significantly less disk space for faster file transfer.
• Devised and developed multiple methods to encode data into smaller sized snippets to optimize for the highest percentage of file size compression.
• Generated multiple test cases to ensure data integrity, in relationship to the
original file, was maintained after performing the uncompressing function.
